## Content Management

This project uses a structured content approach with:

- Markdown files organized by language in the `public/content` directory
- A content registry (`studies-registry.json`) that maps study IDs to their file paths
- Path aliases configured in TypeScript for cleaner imports
- A content management script in the `scripts` directory to help with translation verification and new study creation

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Development

### Code Style

This project uses ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting:

```bash
# Run ESLint
npm run lint

# Run Prettier
npm run format
```

### Adding New Studies

To add a new study:

1. Use the content management script:

```bash
node scripts/content-manager.js create-study --id exodus --title-en "Studies in Exodus" --title-es "Estudios en Ã‰xodo"
```

2. Edit the generated Markdown files in `public/content/en/` and `public/content/es/`
3. Verify translations: `node scripts/content-manager.js check-translations`

## Deployment

This project is deployed using Azure App Service with a CI/CD pipeline configured in GitHub Actions. The workflow in `.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps.yml` handles:

1. Building the React application
2. Setting up a Node.js server to serve the static files
3. Deploying to Azure App Service
